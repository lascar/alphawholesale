For wholesale online.

A Broker is as a man on the middle; everything occurs with his approval.

A Supplier can place an offer, or respond to a tender.

A Customer can command, or put out a tender.

A Product can have a size, an aspect or a packaging.

An Offer has a price for supplier and a price for customer; in the middle... the broker.
